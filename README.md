# simon-dice-arduino
An implementation of the game Simon on Arduino.
I made this project for a contest in 2015.

This contest was about making a game in 1 hour with the components of the Arduino UNO starter kit.

You can see a demo video of the game here: https://www.facebook.com/clubarduinoupv/videos/1047201611985977/?v=1047201611985977
